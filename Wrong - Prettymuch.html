<span class="chord">D</span>                             <span class="chord">Em</span>
 Your're playin' too hard to get
                         <span class="chord">Bm</span>
Like your mind's already set
                <span class="chord">G</span>
Before we even met
<span class="chord">D</span>                               <span class="chord">Em</span>
 Say you need time to feel your best
                            <span class="chord">Bm</span>
While you wonder what's the catch
                             <span class="chord">G</span>
You must think i'm like the rest

<span class="chord">D</span>                                                <span class="chord">Em</span>
When I looking at you, you're looking right pass me
                              <span class="chord">Bm</span>
It's like you tryna distract me
                                          <span class="chord">G</span>
I was there to carry bags that you were unpacking until you stopped asking
<span class="chord">D</span>                                             <span class="chord">Em</span> 
 Love to see you but I hate to see you waste time
                                       <span class="chord">Bm</span>  
Like when he's touchin' on your waist line
                                      <span class="chord">G</span>  
Knowing that I'm yours but you ain't mine

<span class="chord">Bm</span>                                  <span class="chord">G</span>
I just need some time to figure it out with you, is that so wrong?
<span class="chord">D</span>                        <span class="chord">Em</span>

<pre>
<span class="chord">D</span>                            <span class="chord">Em</span>
Do you remember the time we spent
                         <span class="chord">Bm</span> 
You say, "How could I forget?"
                            <span class="chord">G</span>
So tell me why'd you hold your breath?
<span class="chord">D</span>                                    <span class="chord">Em</span>                                        <span class="chord">Bm</span> 
 Everytime I'm with you I just want more of it ain't no question I'm sure of it
                                          <span class="chord">G</span>
And your eyes like stars shining so bright in the moon light feel like I got it all
